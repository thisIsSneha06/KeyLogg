//Note

1. key_log.txt file will be created once you run the logger.pyw, so kindly delete this file for now.
2. Turn off Windows Defender / other security system before running logger.pyw
3. logger_pyw.txt file contains the same code as logger.pyw, incase the file gets automatically deleted by defender as it will consider it as a threat.
