# KeyLogg

1. KeyLogg is a surveillance technology built using Pynput (a Python module) to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard, as long as the logger program keeps running in the system.
2. Generally, a keylogger is used by hackers for unethical purposes. They can register everything you type on the keyboard, including your credentials (credit card numbers, passwords, etc.). But we're good people so we ain't doing that ;). This project has been built for learning purposes only.

//Note

1. key_log.txt file will be created once you run the logger.pyw, so kindly delete this file for now.
2. Turn off Windows Defender / other security system before running logger.pyw
3. logger_pyw.txt file contains the same code as logger.pyw, incase the file gets automatically deleted by defender as it will consider it as a threat.
